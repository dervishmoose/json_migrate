Memorable characters include the menacing lawyer Tulkinghorn, the friendly but depressive John Jarndyce and the childish Harold Skimpole.

The book tells the story of \u201cHuck\u201d Finn (first introduced as Tom Sawyer\u2019s sidekick in <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer<\/em>), his friend Jim, and their journey down the Mississippi River on a raft.  Both are on the run, Huck from his drunk and abusive father, and Jim as a runaway slave.<\/p>\n<p>As Huck and Jim drift down the river, they meet many colorful characters and have many great adventures.  The true heart of the story, however, is the friendship between Huck and Jim.  A constant theme throughout the book is Huck\u2019s internal struggle between what he has been taught, that helping a runaway slave is a sin, and what he truly believes, that Jim is a good man and it couldn\u2019t possibly be wrong to help him.<\/p>\n<p><em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn<\/em> was unique at the time of its publication (1884) because it is narrated by Huck himself and is written in the numerous dialects common in the area and time in which the book is set.

the first great work of the Renaissance. A culmination of the medieval world-view of the afterlife, it establishes the Tuscan dialect in which it is written as the Italian standard, and is seen as one of the greatest works of world literature. - The Divine Comedy is composed of three canticas (or \"cantiche\") \u2014 Inferno (Hell), Purgatorio (Purgatory), and Paradiso (Paradise) \u2014 composed each of 33 cantos (or \"canti\"). The very first canto serves as an introduction to the poem and is generally not considered to be part of the first cantica, bringing the total number of cantos to 100. - The poet tells in the first person his travel through the three realms of the dead, lasting during the Easter Triduum in the spring of 1300.

Stowe was a Connecticut-born teacher at the Hartford Female Academy and an active abolitionist. The novel is believed to have had a profound effect on the North\u2019s view of slavery. In fact, when he met Harriet Beecher Stowe, President Lincoln is said to have commented, \u201cSo you\u2019re the little lady whose book started the Civil War.\u201d First published on March 20, 1852, the story focuses on the tale of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering black slave, the central character around whose life the other characters\u2014both fellow slaves and slave owners\u2014revolve. The novel depicts the harsh reality of slavery while also showing that Christian love and faith can overcome even something as evil as enslavement of fellow human beings.
